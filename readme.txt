I used typescript dependency in order to compile the Typescript code to Javascript (tsconfig.json = typescript compiler configurations).
I used VS Code as IDE and the Live Server VS Code Extension(ritwickdey.LiveServer) in order to launch the project from the index.html file.
I used Jasmine framework for runninng unit tests on the code.
